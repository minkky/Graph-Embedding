The BACE dataset provides quantitative (IC50) and qualitative (binary label) binding results for a set of inhibitors of human β-secretase 1 (BACE-1). All data are experimental values reported in scientific literature over the past decade, some with detailed crystal structures available. A collection of 1522 compounds with their 2D structures and properties are provided.

The data file contains a csv table, in which columns below are used:
     "mol" - SMILES representation of the molecular structure
     "pIC50" - Negative log of the IC50 binding affinity
     "class" - Binary labels for inhibitor
